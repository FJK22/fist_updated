<u><i>Study</i></u>: Howell, P., & Davis, S. (2011). Predicting persistence of and recovery from stuttering at teenage based on information gathered at age eight. Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 32, 196-205.
</p>
<p>
<u><i>Description</i></u>: We took a range of measures when we first saw a group of children who stutter (around age eight). We followed them up until teenage. At teenage, we determined whether each child continued to stutter or not. We investigated which of the measures taken at onset predicted persistence/recovery of stuttering. Of all the measures taken, only a measure of symptom severity predicted the outcome. This prompted us to investigate further things that the symptom severity measure might predict (in particular whether a child is fluent or not).

<u><i>Description</i></u>:  One thing that schools request from us is some primary intervention that they can offer to children. This is to avoid delay. We have had to be very careful to design in-school interventions so that they are innocuous with respect to Speech and Language Therapists’ interventions (i.e. we do not offer any intervention that works at cross purposes with SLTs work). The intervention are another area of intensive activity on FIST.

</p>
<p>
<u><i>Description</i></u>:  Children who have word-finding difficulty can be identified by the pattern of disfluencies in their spontaneous speech; in particular whole-word repetition of prior words often occurs when they cannot retrieve the subsequent word. Work is reviewed that shows whole-word repetitions can be used to identify children from diverse language backgrounds who have word-finding difficulty. The symptom-based identification procedure was validated using a non-word repetition task. Children who were identified as having word-finding difficulty were given phonological training that taught them features of English that they lacked (this depended on their language background). Then they received semantic training. In the cases of children whose first language was not English, the children were primed to use English and then presented with material where there was interference in meanings across the languages (English names had to be produced). It was found that this training improved a range of outcome measures related to education.
